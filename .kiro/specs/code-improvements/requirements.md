# Code Improvements Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the code quality, maintainability, and performance of the Domino's Coupons Finder application, specifically focusing on the email coupons feature and overall application architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Architecture Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the main App component to be broken down into smaller, focused components, so that the codebase is more maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the App.tsx file is analyzed THEN it SHALL be split into components under 200 lines each
2. WHEN components are extracted THEN each SHALL have a single responsibility
3. WHEN new components are created THEN they SHALL use proper TypeScript interfaces
4. WHEN components are refactored THEN existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 2: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load and respond quickly, so that I can efficiently find and email coupons.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN expensive operations are identified THEN they SHALL be memoized using React.useMemo or useCallback
2. WHEN the email modal is used THEN it SHALL be lazy-loaded to improve initial page load
3. WHEN email validation occurs THEN it SHALL be debounced to reduce unnecessary API calls
4. WHEN large coupon lists are displayed THEN performance SHALL not degrade

### Requirement 3: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I receive clear feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught by error boundaries
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN users SHALL receive specific, actionable error messages
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the application SHALL provide retry mechanisms
4. WHEN validation fails THEN users SHALL receive clear feedback with suggestions

### Requirement 4: Security Enhancements

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be secure against common vulnerabilities, so that user data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input is processed THEN it SHALL be properly sanitized
2. WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN it SHALL be resistant to bypass attempts
3. WHEN authentication tokens are used THEN they SHALL be properly validated
4. WHEN email addresses are processed THEN they SHALL be validated against injection attacks

### Requirement 5: Code Organization and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow consistent patterns and be well-organized, so that it's easy to maintain and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation logic is implemented THEN it SHALL use the Strategy pattern
2. WHEN errors are created THEN they SHALL use a Factory pattern
3. WHEN configuration is needed THEN it SHALL be centralized in config files
4. WHEN types are defined THEN they SHALL be comprehensive and reusable

### Requirement 6: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for critical functionality, so that regressions can be prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL have corresponding unit tests
2. WHEN API endpoints are modified THEN they SHALL have integration tests
3. WHEN user interactions are implemented THEN they SHALL have interaction tests
4. WHEN error scenarios exist THEN they SHALL be covered by tests

### Requirement 7: Accessibility Improvements

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the application to be accessible, so that I can use it effectively with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interactive elements are created THEN they SHALL have proper ARIA labels
2. WHEN modal dialogs are shown THEN they SHALL trap focus appropriately
3. WHEN form validation occurs THEN errors SHALL be announced to screen readers
4. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN all functionality SHALL be accessible
